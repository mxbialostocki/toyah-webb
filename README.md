# toyah-webb
A creative website to showcase poetry by Toyah Webb.

Previously I had written code to publish a digital version of two poems for Auckland-based poet Toyah Webb. This project is a framework to merge those two collaborations into a single site, with the functionality to allow future work to be added as well.

There is a natural conflict between code readability and the impenetrable, chaotic nature of the source poetry. I wanted to create a web App that reflected both my approach to coding as well as a dedication to the nature of the poems themselves. Observe the differences between the HTML & CSS elements of the project with the resulting React framework.

To do: 
1. Main.jsx renders entry points to two poems
2. Separate custom css sheets for each one
 - consider merging css into one sheet 
3. Verify audio files
4. Landing page starts with only a name, then fades to Main.jsx
5. Refactor structure to allow for addition of new works
6. Verify typefaces with author of works
